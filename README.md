# Predictive Maintenance for Smart Farming Machinery

This project predicts machinery component failure using time-series sensor data, enabling smart farming operations to minimize downtime and maintenance costs.

## Features
- Time-series data processing and cleaning
- Feature engineering (sliding windows, statistical and gradient features)
- ML + DL model training (RandomForest, XGBoost, LSTM)
- Executive-level reporting with decision insights
